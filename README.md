# C Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my C Programming Portfolio! This repository showcases a range of C programming examples, including fundamental algorithms, data structures, utility functions, and practical projects.

## Contents

- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and other fundamental algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of linked lists, trees, and more.
- **Utilities**: Utility functions covering file handling, string manipulation, memory management, and mathematical operations.
- **Basic Problems**: Solutions to common coding problems and exercises.
- **Projects**: Complete projects demonstrating practical applications of C.

## How to Use

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to compile and run the code. Explore the examples to see how various programming concepts are implemented.
